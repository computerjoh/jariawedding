        Wedding Registry
      </h1>

      <p class="mb-6 text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        We are so grateful to celebrate our wedding with you.
        Your love, support, and presence truly mean the world to us.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-6 text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        We're fortunate to already have what we need for our home, so we've
        chosen not to create a traditional registry. If you were hoping to give
        a gift, we're currently saving toward our first home together.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-8 text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        Please know that gifts are completely optional, we're simply happy
        you're celebrating with us.
      </p>
