We met on Hinge, not expecting much, until Aria messaged John out of the blue and asked him to go to IHOP. John lied about liking The Smiths. That first date turned into pancakes and a long drive around Flagstaff, where we realized how much we had in common. It felt easy from the start. This first date led to countless others, ranging from ice skating to free climbing (Aria almost died).<br/><br/>

Six months later, we moved in together. Not long after, we welcomed our beautiful daughter Button to the world and she took over the apartment. Life since then has been shared space, shared playlists, and learning how to live together.</p><br/><br/>

John proposed to Aria at the top of Bear Peak, the highest point in Boulder. The answer was yes (after dry heaving for a few minutes).</p><br/><br/>
